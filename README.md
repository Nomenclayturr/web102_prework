# WEB102 Prework - Sea Monster Games

Submitted by: Emmanuel Ademola

Sea Monster Game is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 20 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following required functionality is completed:

* [ ] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [ ] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [ ] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [ ] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following optional features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
I added a white shadow to the unfunded, funded, and all games buttons with it being bolded when hovered. I also made the game card italicized if the user hovers over.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
 The most challenging part for me was initally understanding the questions and how I needed to approach in order to solve them. Learning about DOM manipulation and what it was took a little while to understand, the ternary operator was also really abstract and took me awhile to get an idea of what it did. Setting the inner HTML using a template literal took ages and was the one thing that took most of my time to figure out.
